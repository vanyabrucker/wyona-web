<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>III. General provisions on data processing</strong></p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>1. Scope of the processing of personal data</strong></p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06">
  As a matter of principle, we only collect and use your personal data insofar as this is necessary for the provision of a functional website as well as our contents and services or to initiate and discuss a business relationship, a business contact or to establish, implement and terminate our cooperation and the processing is legally permissible, i.e. purpose-bound and based on a legal basis.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>2. Deletion of data and storage periods</strong></p>
<p>
  Your data will be deleted or anonymized as soon as the purpose of processing, in particular storage, ceases to apply. In addition, storage may take place if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws (e.g. GDPR, tax, accounting retention obligations) or other provisions to which the controller is subject.
</p>
<p>
  Data will also be disabled or erased if a retention period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need to continue storing the data, e.g. for the execution or performance of a contract.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>IV. Provision of the website and setting of log files</strong></p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>1. Description and scope of data processing</strong></p>
<p>
  Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer.
</p>
<p>
  The following data is collected:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>Approximate location based on IP range</li>
  <li>Browser type</li>
  <li>The Wyona pages visited by the users on an anonymized basis</li>
  <li>Date and duration of the visit on an anonymized basis</li>
  <li>Operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the case of a registered user, this data is also stored in the log files of our system. Your IP addresses or other data that enable the data to be assigned to you as a user are not permanently stored in the log files, unless their processing is temporarily necessary, e.g. for the delivery and presentation of our website.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>2. Legal basis for the data processing</strong></p>
<p>
  Insofar as your visit to our website serves the purpose of initiating a business contact, establishing, implementing or terminating our cooperation, the legal basis for the temporary processing is Article 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. In other cases, the legal basis is Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, insofar as our interest in the processing outweighs the interest of the data subject.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>3. Purpose of the data processing</strong></p>
<p>
  When visiting our website, the temporary processing, in particular storage, of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the delivery of the website to the user&#39;s computer. To the latter purpose, the user&#39;s IP address has to be stored for the duration of the session.
</p>
<p>
  These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in the data processing pursuant to Article 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Insofar as the visit to our website serves the purpose of initiating, implementing or terminating the business relationship, this purpose at the same time also constitutes the purpose of the processing.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>V. Contact sheet and e-mail correspondence</strong></p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>1. Description and scope of data processing</strong></p>
<p>
  A contact form is available on our website, which can be used for electronic communications. If a user takes advantage of this option, the data entered in the input mask will be transmitted to us and stored. The Data is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First and last name</li>
  <li>E-mail</li>
  <li>Company</li>
  <li>Country</li>
  <li>Organization type</li>
  <li>The following data is also stored at the time the message is sent: 
    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>Date and time of registration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is possible to contact us via the e-mail address on
        <a href="mailto:contact@wyona.com">contact@wyona.com</a>
   or, in the case of enquiries about data protection, via 
        <a href="mailto:michael.wechner@wyona.com">michael.wechner@wyona.com</a>
   In this case, the personal data transmitted with the e-mail (surname, first name, e-mail address, message content) will be processed.
</p>
<p>
  In this context, the data will not be transferred to third parties. The data is primarily used for processing the conversation or for initiating, implementing or terminating the business relationship.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>2. Legal basis for the data processing</strong></p>
<p>
  The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted is the so-called legitimate interest, which exists in the course of sending an e-mail is Article 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>
  If the e-mail contact aims at the initiation, implementation and termination of the business relationship, the additional legal basis for the processing is Article 6 para. lit. b) GDPR.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>3. Purpose of the data processing</strong></p>
<p>
  The processing of the personal data from the input mask serves mainly to process the contact and communication. When contact is made by e-mail, the necessary legitimate interest in processing the data lies in the processing of the contact.
</p>
<p>
  The other personal data processed during the sending process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
</p>
<p>
  Insofar as you contact us for the purpose of initiating, implementing or terminating the business relationship, these are also the purposes of the processing.
</p>
<p className="margin--top--spacing-06"><strong>VI. Newsletter</strong></p>
